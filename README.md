# COAR_Fall2020

In Fall 2020, I conducted research on different algorithims aimed at improving the efficiency of the regular Q-Learning algorithim. I covered the Double Q- Learning algorithm, and the Fitted Q- Learning algorithm. 

## Double Q Learning

The paper for the Double Q-Learning algorithm can be found [link](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2010/file/091d584fced301b442654dd8c23b3fc9-Paper.pdf "here"). 

My code is all in one file (DoubleQ_MPD.ipynb) and covers the code using a Uniform, Epsilon Greedy, and Boltzmann behavior policies (generally with constant step size = 0.1). I analyzed the difference in convergence rates against regular Q-Learning using number of iterations as well as runtime. Using both analyzes I found that the results were inconclusive. 

## Fitted Q Learning
The paper for the Fitted Q-Learning algorithm can be found [link](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume6/ernst05a/ernst05a.pdf "here").
